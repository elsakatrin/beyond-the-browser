Module 6 - project: beyond-the-browser

For this project I used https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/ this tutorial to learn more about react native and expo.
I liked going through it and it was cool to use Expo Go app in my phone to see the frontend as soon as I save my code.
And it was also nice seeing all the console errors in my phone as soon as they showed up. I also had the localhost open in my computer to compare the changes in browser vs phone. 
I liked seeing how easy it was to set up a function where you can upload an image, add stickers into it and then save it to your phone or computer. 

I commented in the code to try to explain what was happening in there, because the app.js is kind of crowded and a lot happening in there.
