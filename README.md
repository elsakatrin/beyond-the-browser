Module 6 - project: beyond-the-browser

For this project I used https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/ this tutorial to learn more about react native and expo.
I liked going through it and it was cool to use Expo Go app in my phone to see the frontend as soon as I save my code.
And it was also nice seeing all the console errors in my phone as soon as they showed up. I also had the localhost open in my computer to compare the changes in browser vs phone. 
I thought it was fun to try out React Native for the fist time and Expo to, it's a bit different than what I'm used to. I'm exited to try it out again and do something myself after getting this intro into how it works. 
I liked seeing how easy it was to set up a function where you can upload an image, add stickers into it and then save it to your phone or computer. 
In the repository there's a photo called Frame 1, it has a QR code to check out the app in a phone.
In this application you can upload (and/or take a photo in mobile), you can add a sticker to it and move it around the image. When you've done that you can save your picture to your device. 

I commented in the code to try to explain what was happening in there, because the app.js is kind of crowded and a lot happening in there.
